## Vision

This project was created to try something fun and light-hearted.
The premise of all this is to be able to draw on various backgrounds
and after you are satisfied with your drawing - to export it and save
it to your device, be it mobile or a desktop.

## Struggles

The biggest issue was exporting the image. Both the image and the drawing
individually were no problem, but to stack the different layers together
was proving to be a bit problematic. Eventually that got resolved

## Technology Used

-   React JS
-   React-Canvas-Draw
